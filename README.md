# hello-world
Obviously the same repository

About me huh, well not too much to share i guess
at the moment of writing, i am a 23 year old guy. who always has been interested in IT.
Studying however, was not my best feature.. i quit my first IT related study, due to a lack of internship and challanges..
Kinda made up for that by getting a Comptia certification, which i am not really using.
Besides a hobbyist PC Technician, i also [b]try[/b] to produce, and mix music sometimes

IT Related, i have my focus mostly on networking and anything that could ever go wrong with your PC.. all learned by experience and some good google searches :)

Anyhow, i wanted to get started with an attempt to "code" using Visual Studio, yeah.. there you go already
So here the journey begins on GitHub, we'll see how it goes

So yeah thanks and see yall around (is this even public)?
